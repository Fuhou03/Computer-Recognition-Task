# Summer 2020 Image Recognition Task by Fu-Hou Hy

###### Travel and tourism
Facial recognition technology in travel and tourism offers numerous benefits for those travelling and for the staff working. One main benefit would be the increased security throughout places such as hotels and airports. For instance, facial recognition can be used to identify guests and grant them access to their hotel rooms, which could be more convenient for the guests. This helps prevent crime by stopping unrecognised people from entering the room. This technology may also be used to identify troublesome guests who have been banned from the hotel and then alert the staff. Or, scan through crowds at airports to identify suspects and similarly, report them to the staff/police.\
However, facial recognition software is extremely advanced and expensive to implement, hence it would not be used in many hotels. For identifying criminals/troublesome guests, it would require high tech cameras to guarantee speed and accuracy which also comes at a high cost. Plus, the technology could malfunction and allow an unauthorised visitor into someones room.

###### Gaming and entertainment
3D scanning and facial recognition technology working together can allow users to create characters ingame that accurately reflect their own facial movements. Furthermore, it can let users control certain ingame elements by tracking eye movements, instead of having to manually click on it.\
However, theres a possibility of it being exploited and criminals could watch users without them knowing, such as through a web cam.

###### Education and learning
One way that image recognition can be used in education is by scanning images/objects with devices such as mobile phones. Once the item is recognised, the device can show text or play a video, supplying the user with a range of information about it. For example, an image of a body part can be scanned, allowing the user to learn about it. Likewise, it is capable of scanning text and converting it into audio for someone to listen to. This may assist people with learning difficulties. \
However, objects will not all look the same despite being of the same type. For instance, pens can come in a range of shapes or sizes, hence the image recognition could have some difficulties recognising certain objects.

###### Transport and navigation
Image recognition has an increasingly important role in transport and navigation today. Self-driving cars utilise this technlogy to quickly detect traffic lights, road signs, other vehicles and pedestrians to stay safe on the road. Traffic lights could communicate with cars and therefore manage traffic with perfect efficiency, reducing the number of accidents. Drones can be used to safely deliver items to customers by avoiding obstacles midair.\
Despite the benefits, theres always a chance of the technology failing and consequently an accident may occur.

###### Medicine and healthcare
Image recognition can be used for analysing images or data for patients and then comparing it to a database to diagnose the patient. Algorithms can be trained in recognising and classifying things such as cancer. This data is likely to be more precise than doctors, thus lesssening workload and allowing doctors to provide personalised treatment for their patients. As technology advances, machines may be able to carry out surgery or advanced treatment with the help of fast image recognition.\
Although there are many benefits, the advancement of technology could result in less jobs being available as many roles will be taken by machines, hence some people could struggle to find a suitable job.
