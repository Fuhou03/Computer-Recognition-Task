###### Travel and tourism
Facial recognition technology in travel and tourism offers numerous benefits for those travelling and for the staff working. One main benefit would be the increased security throughout places such as hotels and airports. For instance, facial recognition can be used to identify guests and grant them access to their hotel rooms, which could be more convenient for the guests. This helps prevent crime by stopping unrecognised people from entering the room. This technology may also be used to identify troublesome guests who have been banned from the hotel and then alert the staff. Or, identify criminals at airports and similarly, report them to the staff/police.\
However, facial recognition software is extremely advanced and expensive to implement, hence it would not be used in many hotels. For identifying criminals/troublesome guests, it would require high tech cameras to guarantee speed and accuracy which also comes at a cost.
